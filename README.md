# OSINT-Flowcharts-by-IntelTechniques

<h2>Overview</h2>
I recently watched the OSINT Curious youtube tutorial on "Introduction to OSINT" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNeCqw8OLeA). The tutorial covered different basic OSINT techniques, including methodologies on how to link and connect data discovered from OSINT investigations. During this segment, two resources were highlighted: Micah Hoffman's tool available at https://yoga.myosint.training and the IntelTechniques tool located at https://inteltechniques.com/blog/2018/03/06/updated-osint-flowcharts.
<br />
Upon attempting to access the IntelTechniques tool, I discovered that the webpage was no longer available:

  So, I did some OSINT research and I found the content of the webpage. It contained an image walkthrough on how to follow through with OSINT investigations when you have the Domain Name, Email address, Location, Real Name, Telephone Number, and Username of a target.
